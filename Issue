Laptop screen cracked and has dead pixels due to accidental slip on marble stairs. Need repair support.


While coming to office, I slipped on the marble stairs near the parking area and fell on my bag that had the laptop. My heels also broke during the fall. Initially I thought the impact was minor, but after powering on the laptop, I noticed a screen crack and dead pixels. I always handle the laptop carefully â€” this was a genuinely unexpected accident. Reporting it as soon as I noticed the issue. Kindly assist with the repair process.
